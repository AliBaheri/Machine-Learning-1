* Week #2: Univariate / Multivariate Linear Regression.
* Week #3: Logistic Regression, and Regularized Logistic Regression.
    Note that, Regularized Logistic Regression is applied with various `lambdas` to find a good fit data and the good decision boundary. If `lambda` is too large, underfitting the data (`lambda`~100). Otherwise, if it is too small, overfitting the data (`lambda`~0).   
* Week #4: Neural Network with handwritten prediction. Use `feedforward propagation algorithm` to predict the labels of training sets. 
* Week #5: Neural Network Training with handwritten. Use `backpropagation algorithm` to predict the labels of training sets.
